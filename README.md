# Traveling_salesman
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) one of the most studied discrete optimization problems. 
A very interesting NP-hard problem, it is easy to formulate, difficult to solve and has a
large number of applications. In fact the TSP can be applied to solve many practical prob-
lems within our daily lives. As I mentioned TSP is a NP-hard problem, thus by solution we 
donâ€™t mean a polynomial time solution, in fact such a solution does not exist. 
But one can always apply stochastic algorithms and be satisfied with
a good solution which is not necessary the optimal solution. Here we want to test some 
algorithms by applying to TSP.
